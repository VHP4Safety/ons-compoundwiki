# VHP4Safety Compound Wiki

Open Notebook Science scripts for the [VHP4Safety Compound Wiki](https://compoundcloud.wikibase.cloud/).

## Using the wiki

There are two Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to use the wiki in Python:

* [Getting names and SMILES for the VHP compounds](nb/Getting_names_and_SMILES_for_the_VHP_compounds.ipynb)
* [Getting properties by SMILES using the VHP4Safety Compound Wiki](nb/Getting_properties_by_SMILES_using_the_VHP4Safety_Compound_Wiki.ipynb)
